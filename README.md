- 👋 Hi, I’m @AminouZakara. I'm a Junior Web Developer who graduated from the Computer and Instructional Technologies department.
  At the same time, I'm an English teacher. I'd taught English in Turkey for the last five years. While teaching English as a full-time teacher,
  I've been also boosting myself in programming by designing and developing websites and applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a freelancer.

- 👀 I’m very interested in programming, reason why I've continuously been improving myself in it while teaching English.

- 👀👀 This year, I boosted myself more by taking an online course to learn React.js and become a Front End Web Developer.

- 🌱 I’m currently using React.js to design and develop websites and applications. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to effectively collaborate on a development project with developers.
